📚 Interactive Guide to Google Gemini for Grocery Suppliers
This project is a single-page interactive web application (SPA) designed to serve as a quick, user-friendly guide for grocery suppliers interested in leveraging the basic and intermediate functions of Google Gemini within their daily workflows.

The application translates key Gemini capabilities into an organized, tab-based interface, focusing on practical, industry-relevant examples related to logistics, inventory management, and supplier communication.

🚀 Key Features
The guide is structured into two primary, interactive sections for non-linear exploration:

1. 🏢 Office Tools
This section demonstrates how Gemini integrates with Google Workspace (Gmail, Meet, Calendar) to automate routine administrative tasks:

Email Writing & Polishing: Focuses on drafting supplier confirmations, updating delivery schedules, and refining logistical requests.

Calendar Summary & Actions: Prompts for scheduling quality control audits and summarizing important negotiation meetings.

Meeting Notes & Actions (Meet): Explains the automatic generation of meeting summaries and critical action items related to inventory and compliance.

2. 💡 Productivity & Content Acceleration
This section showcases Gemini's power in content creation, research, and strategic planning:

Document Summaries & Q&A: Quickly extracting key data, such as spoilage rates from quarterly reports or identifying compliance issues in PDFs.

Brainstorming & Ideation: Generating creative ideas for new product lines and role-playing conversations with specific buyer personas.

Training & Podcast Material: Creating structured training outlines for staff on topics like cold chain compliance and safety checklists.

Mind Map Creation: Using Gemini to structure complex, hierarchical concepts like a seasonal produce sourcing strategy.

🛠️ Technology Stack
This application is built entirely within a single, self-contained file (gemini_interactive_guide.html) for maximum portability and ease of deployment.

Structure & Logic: HTML5, Vanilla JavaScript

Styling & Responsiveness: Tailwind CSS

Data Visualization: Chart.js (for the Usage Overview)
